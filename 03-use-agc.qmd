# Use Case 1: Above Ground Carbon

As part of the Nature Returns research project with Natural England, the LIMMMA team worked with Kew Wakehurst on landscape-based carbon storage modelling.
This involved using habitat maps, remote sensing data and equations for estimating the amount of carbon stored above ground (in vegetation such as trees and hedgerows) and below ground (in soils) across a diverse landscape of woodland, grassland and built up areas at different scales including 1) Wakehurst site, 2) Wealden District Council, 3) Southeast England with potential to be scaled nationally.

In the following walkthrough we demonstrate how the above ground carbon models were created and tested using LIMMMA.

## Methodologies and Datasets

Our aim in this project was to create a workflow for generating and improving geospatial estimates of the amount of carbon stored above ground in the natural landscape which met the following requirements:

1. Use open access national datasets.
2. Scaleable from local to national.
3. Easily compare across different models at different scales.
4. Rapidly improve with new data, equations (e.g. allometric) and methodologies as they emerge from ongoing research.

The data and methods adopted are summarised in the following diagram.

Two options for generating the habitat basemap for carbon estimates were imported: one from CEH and the other from LE.
LIDAR and Sentinel Satellite imagery provided the two options for topology estimation.
Additional data included CEH hedgerows and OS 25cm arial photography.
These data were variously used in different methods of carbon storage calculation using a cell-based approach.
The four methodologies listed below build on each other iteratively to progress towards a more precise estimate of carbon storage generated by increasingly complex models with potential for continuous improvement.

In the image below we can see how each model progressively improves the fidelity of carbon estimate maps by variously increasing their resolution and coverage.

And here is an example of the outputs from the model in LIMMMA map view at different scales.

The following section describes how each of these models was built and how the outputs were created and analysed to draw conclusions about the different levels and sources of uncertainty associated with each.

## Implementing models

Each model was built in LIMMMA's graphical modelling system. The following diagram shows how this is used to connect data, methods and outputs in a single visual interface.

In this section we present a series of step-by-step guides showing you how to reproduce the final feature height model from scratch. Each part of the process is illustrated in slide show format (see below).

### Select datasets

Having created a new project and set our desired extent, we can open the model view and start building. At first, you will be presented with a blank screen with no visible controls. Don't worry, the first thing to do is to add the various components you want to include in your model. This is done by simply right clicking the screen and selecting from a list of various types of components (see below). Datasets will include whatever your team has imported into your LIMMMA workspace. In addition to datasets there are numerous components for transforming inputs from those datasets in various ways and converting them into outputs for use in map view or in other models.

The first step in building our model is to add to the model the various datasets we need.
