![Pan to the top right of the model canvas and add a cluster of: "Merge", "Power" and "Numeric constant."](01-merge.png)

---

![Rename the "Merge" component to "Combined uncertainty," and update the "Numeric constant" to 0.5 and name it "square root." Connect the components as shown.](02-merge-connected-habitat.png)

---

![Zoomed out, you can see the merge cluster top right taking the output from the habitat disagreement part of the model.](03-merge-zoom.png)

---

![Connect the outputs from each of the other two uncertainty calculations as shown here.](04-connected-measurement-false.png)

---

![Finally, we can add the output to Map view with the name "Standard Deviation absolute" and add the appropriate units.](05-power-units.png)

---

![The complete model should now look like this.](06-complete.png)

---

![In Map view, adjust the fill mode for the "Standard Deviation" layer to RdBu to make obvious the areas of highest uncertainty.](07-map-view.png)
