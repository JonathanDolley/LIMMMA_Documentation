---

![Link up only the land cover classes we are interested in as shown.](08-boolean-inputs.png)

---

![Connect a 'Map layer' component to add the categorical dataset to Map view. ](09-categorical-output.png)

---

![Run the model and toggle to Map view. If you make the original UKECH layer invisible you will see that your new map layer displays only over the project extent.](10-map-ukceh-invisible.png)

![Select the new layer and you will notice that you can change the colour of each class and also select each layer individually to be visible or not.](11-land-cover-wealden.png)

![You can change the colour scheme by clicking each colour box and selecting from the palette.](12-change-colours.png)
