# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The University of Sussex LIMMMA tool is designed to contribute to the timely and effective use of evidence for collaborative sustainable multifunctional land use. Our central aims in developing this tool are to:

- support the rapid sharing and analysis of new data and model developments that have implications for sustainable land use  policy and land management practices;
- support efforts to scale up and extrapolate from new empirical findings as appropriate;
- support engagement with the uncertainties involved and comparisons with existing data sets and model outputs to inform bespoke decision making;
- to enable specialists and non-specialists to engage more quickly and easily with the evidence, assumptions and uncertainties involved in developing, selecting and monitoring land management options.

## What is LIMMMA and who is it for? {.unnumbered}

In the simplest technical terms, LIMMMA is a web-application with mapping and modelling functions and a growing set of built-in datasets which can be augmented with additional data layers generated or owned by users themselves. It consists of a map screen and model screen through which the user can interact with projects on specific geographical areas (extents) to generate outputs in the form of maps and datasets.

There are at least four types of user we have in mind:

> ***1. Scientific Research Teams seeking to improve models of landscape function***
>
> Scientific teams like [Kew Science](https://www.kew.org/science) are doing field-based research and biophysical modelling to understand the relationships between carbon storage, biodiversity and landscape management practices. They need to be able to easily iterate between emerging data and evolving models while comparing results between different models at various scales. As understanding of the potential implications of these models for land use decision making evolve, LIMMMA can provide a platform to visualise the results, scale up findings as appropriate and support dialogue at the science policy interface.
>
> ***2. Large Multi-site Research Projects***
>
> Large scale multi-site research projects such as the Nature Returns works at multiple pilot sites, seeking to understand how nature based solution interventions can restore and create habitats to obtain multiple benefits for nature and people at the landscape scale. LIMMMA can help with sharing the data across sites and learning together rapidly with multi-site visualisation and analysis They need to be able to integrate diverse types of geospatial data into models and maps for complex analysis while also making outputs and evidence accessible to other expert and non-expert stakeholders alike. 
>
> ***3. Practitioners***
>
> Practitioners such as the Local Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS) teams are designing landscape wide strategies for nature recovery projects in consultation with communities. They need opportunity maps that can be readily improved with input from local stakeholders and which provide transparency over candidate site selection. They also need to be able to bring together multiple datasets, models and maps from other planning and policy units so that local site-level assessments and plans can be understood in the wider context.
>
> ***4. Communities***
>
> Local communities - residents, farmers, advocacy groups, councils etc. - are the ones most directly affected by policies and interventions around land-use change and landscape management and they are critical to the success of any landscape scale strategies. They need to be able to gather local evidence and create their own bespoke maps to convey their experience of and vision for nature recovery and NBS projects in their localities. These can help to amplify local community voices in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects and support the democratisation of landscape planning.

Our vision is to develop the LIMMMA tool into a 'virtual living lab for multifunctional landscapes' that would provide a basis for bringing formal science and other insights together as a common resource. It would enable a coalition of research and practitioner teams to progressively build up an understanding and visualisation of the changing function and values of landscapes. It could provide a platform for participatory assessment of the implications of different land use interventions, integrated with dynamic maps that are updated with new evidence and stories of change. By facilitating engagement between scientists, practitioners, communities and policy makers, such a virtual living lab would support a more responsive and participatory strategy for multifunctional landscapes. Towards this goal, we are beginning to work with stakeholders to scope this initiative out in particular places beginning with the Wealden District Council area in the south coast region (see map below).

This book of documentation introduces the LIMMMA tool, outlines its key features and explains how it can be used in a number of example use-cases with a step-by-step walkthrough for each case.
The introduction describes the development of LIMMMA over several years by a multidisciplinary team at the University of Sussex and puts in a wider context of ongoing transdisciplinary research to which it contributes.
Chapter 1 outlines the key features
Chapter 2 takes the reader from zero to the basics of how to set up an account, create a new project and add map layers.
Chapters 3, 4 and 5 detail three specific use cases to demonstrate how the tool can be used in each case.
Finally, chapter 6 gets into the more technical detail about how the AI component is used to support land use classifications.

If you want to know more about the history and development of the project before going further you can read about it in the section below. Otherwise, if you want to learn about the tool itself, please head straight to chapter 1.

## Background and acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

The University of Sussex [LIMMMA](https://landscapes.wearepal.ai/) tool (Landscape Integrative Mapping and Modelling for Multifunctional Analysis) is an evolving project that began in 2017 with a new multi-disciplinary collaboration between the University's Science Policy Research Unit ([SPRU](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/business-school/people-and-departments/spru)) and the Predictive Analytics Lab ([PAL](https://wearepal.ai)) within the Informatics department.

This initial proof of concept stage of development was funded by the University of Sussex's [SSRP](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-sustainability-research-programme/) initiative (Sussex Sustainability Research Programme). Just as machine learning and AI was beginning to be applied more widely to computer vision problems such as object detection and image segmentation this project brought together a core team of researchers to develop a web-application to enable AI-assisted land cover and land use classification for geospatial analysis.
By collaborating across the traditional separation between social science and engineering we were able create a bespoke tool for non-expert users to generate and analyse LULC (land use land cover) maps from satellite imagery in peri-urban contexts where conventional methods of land cover classification break down due to the complexity of the landscape.

The British Academy funded our team to continue development of the tool as part of an interdisciplinary research project titled [“Inclusive Green Infrastructures for Urban Wellbeing”](https://agri-food-transformations.netlify.app/) under the British Academy Urban Infrastructures of Well-being Programme.
During this phase of development, a prototype modelling system was built into the tool to enable the analysis of land use changes over time and to implement a scoring system to visualise the impacts of those changes on different stakeholders.

Subsequently, our team joined a large consortium project to apply and further develop the LIMMMA tool to support decision and policy making around nature recovery, nature based solutions and multifunctional landscape strategies. This is a £12.5 billion pilot project called ["Nature Based Solutions for Climate Change at the Landscape Level"](https://naturalengland.blog.gov.uk/2021/07/23/nature-based-solutions-for-climate-change-at-the-landscape-scale-a-new-12-5m-pilot-programme/) funded by the Joint Treasury Outcome Fund. It runs from 2021-2025 and is led by Natural England and the Sussex team co-Is (working directly with Kew Science) are Fiona Marshall, Novi Quadrianto, Jeremy Reffin.

During this project we completely rebuilt the LIMMMA tool to enhance and fully integrate the mapping, modelling and AI elements. Alongside this we worked with scientists at Kew to use LIMMMA to support their emerging work on landscape-based carbon and biodiversity monitoring and modelling. The culmination of this work is the LIMMMA tool presented in this documentation. However, it is not simply a finished piece of software but is part of an ongoing transdisciplinary research effort to support creative engagement over landscape management strategies between multiple stakeholders from policy makers to local communities and scientific researchers. As such, we see LIMMMA as an evolving platform around which to gather these diverse stakeholders for engagement with emerging evidence and differing values and assumptions about how we want to improve our local and national landscapes.
